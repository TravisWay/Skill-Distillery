# Jets Project
## Second-Week Graded Project
### Travis Way, Skill Distillery student

This is my week 2 homework project.   Key Topics include:
*OOP
*Inheritance
*Polymorphism

The user will be prompted by a menu screen as the program is run.  They will have the choice of seeing a list of Jets in the hangar, finding the fastest plane, finding the plane with the longest range, adding a plane to the hangar, or quitting the application.

The jet objects are all added to a object array and finding either the fastest or the plane with the longest range involves searching that array.  Adding a plane takes in the necessary parameters and adds it to the object array so that they may be seen and searchable as well.
