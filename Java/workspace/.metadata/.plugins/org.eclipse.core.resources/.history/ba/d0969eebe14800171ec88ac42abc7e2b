## Travis's Make Change Project

MakeChangeProject is a Java program that allows the user to enter total cost and amount being tendered(doubles) into the console with the bills and coins necessary to give the proper change being printed back to the console. 

The program will tell the user if not enough money was given to be tendered or if the exact amount was given. 

The program will ask the user for the next transaction information once the first transaction is complete. 

The program will run until 000 is entered for the total or amount tendered.
