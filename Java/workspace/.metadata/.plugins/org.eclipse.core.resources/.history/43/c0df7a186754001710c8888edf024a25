#BlackJack Project
## Travis Way's Skill Distillery Project

This java application after making cards, a deck, a table, and the players runs through a Blackjack game.  The player plays against the computer and attempts to get as close to 21 with the card values provided(aces are only worth 1 in this game).  The player after being dealt 2 cards can decide to hit or stay.  After they either bust(go over 21) or decide to stay, the dealer then has a chance to do the same thing. The AI is setup to where if their hand value is equal to or less than 15 they will hit.  

After both decide to stay and have not busted, the final tallies are taken and a winner is printed.
