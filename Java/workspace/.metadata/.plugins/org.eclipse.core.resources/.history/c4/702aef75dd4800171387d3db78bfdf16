## Travis's Make Change Project

MakeChangeProject is a Java program that allows the user to enter total cost and amount being tendered(doubles) into the console with the bills and coins necessary to give the proper change being printed back to the console. 

The program will run until 000 is entered for the total or amount tendered.
